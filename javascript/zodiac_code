She is the mother of the Messor people, an ancient race depicted with physical prowess exponentially greater than today’s average person. Legend says that these were one of the original people, and also guardians over the land who conquered everything upon it with their superior strength. Land under their protection was known to be extremely fruitful and pure as they were not only warriors, but quite skilled laborers.<br><br>They rose to establish a glorious empire that stretched across more than half of the earth. Their only competition was the Solarius people, another ancient race known to have fire of the sun flowing through them. After a great golden age their empire collapsed due to infighting, and the remains of their people were scattered.',

I think he wants to go to law school too. Sasha on the other hand seems very shy, I don\’t see him out a lot. What I do know is that he hasn\’t decided on a major yet. When the two come together Sasha is spoken for by Alek and their combined persona snaps together in a stoic way. Luckily it\’s not too hard to tell them apart. Alek likes to wear a red scarf while the other wears a blue one. I\’ve also noticed another boy likes to accompany them.
